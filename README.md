# ITensor deconstructed: rewriting ITensors.jl

This repository contains a notebook `itensor-deconstructed.jl` that demonstrates a new set of packages
that are being developed as part of a rewrite of [ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl).

Note that the notebook relies on a number of packages that are registered in the
[ITensor registry](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensorRegistry), you will need to add that
registry before you can run the notebook.
