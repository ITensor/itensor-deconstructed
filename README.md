# ITensor deconstructed: rewriting ITensors.jl

This repository contains a notebook [itensor-deconstructed.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/itensor-deconstructed/blob/main/itensor-deconstructed.jl) that demonstrates a new set of packages
that are being developed as part of a [rewrite of ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl/pull/1611).

You can view a static webpage generated from the notebook here: [https://itensor.github.io/itensor-deconstructed/itensor-deconstructed.html](https://itensor.github.io/itensor-deconstructed/itensor-deconstructed.html).

Note that the notebook relies on a number of packages that are registered in the
[ITensor registry](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensorRegistry), you will need to add that
registry before you can run the notebook locally.
